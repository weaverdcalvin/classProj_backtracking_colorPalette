# classProj_backtracking_colorPalette
Java assignment. Uses a recursive backtracking method to create an arrangement of colors based on file input.

Assignment Description:
A paint shop owner is faced with the problem of displaying N distinct vertical color strips representing all available paint colors at the shop. The most popular colors are to be displayed on the left side of the wall, proceeding with the less popular colors towards the right side. However, there are certain pairs of colors that cannot be placed next to each other for
aesthetic reasons. Your basic task is to write software to produce the color arrangement that, for each position starting at the left, selects the most popular unused color that does not conflict with the previous color and that allows all N colors to be displayed.
